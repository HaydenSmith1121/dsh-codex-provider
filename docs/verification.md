## The fallback route, and what the models page receives

The plugin prefers the `codex` route and falls back to `codex-provider` when
another adapter already owns the name. That path had never been exercised
end-to-end, and it is the one a user is most likely to hit without realising it —
any other plugin or a hand-written `llm-pi-ai.providers.codex` entry triggers it.

`test/settings-page.test.mjs` mounts the plugin with an impostor adapter already
holding `codex`, then checks what the Settings → Models page will actually
receive:

- the plugin serves `codex-provider` rather than failing;
- **the directory row follows the route actually served** — a row advertising
  `codex` while the plugin serves `codex-provider` would point the page at
  someone else's adapter;
- the impostor's route is untouched;
- the `llm-codex` namespace still installs;
- the fallback route is *usable* — it lists models, not merely registers.

The same file also pins the non-fallback contract: every directory entry names a
route that is actually registered, carries the metadata a row needs, and its
namespace resolves to a section holding the fields the page renders.

## What is still not verified, and the honest limits of each check

Two things could not be confirmed against the live backend, and neither is
papered over:

**1. The usage endpoint path.** `USAGE_PATH = '/usage'` was written from the
shape other providers use, not from evidence. Probing candidates against the real
backend returned a uniform **403 HTML page for every path — including nonsense
ones** — which means Cloudflare rejected the request shape before path routing
was ever reached. That probe therefore proved *nothing*, and the path remains an
assumption. It is low-risk only because `read()` returns `undefined` on any
non-200 or unparseable body and the feature is decorative: a wrong path means
the usage pill never appears, not a broken turn. `test/usage.test.mjs` pins that
contract from eight angles, including that a missing credential makes no request
and a slow endpoint cannot hang the caller.

**2. The streaming event vocabulary.** See the dedicated section below.

## Isolated-harness installation, re-run against the finished code

The install-and-boot check was first done early, before the plugin gained origin
failover, version discovery, and settings handling — so it was re-run against
the current code on a **fresh** `DSH_HOME`:

```sh
DSH_HOME=<scratch> dsh plugin --profile web add <package>
DSH_HOME=<scratch> dsh web --port 3097 --no-open
```

- `dsh.profile.bundles` gained `dsh-codex-provider`.
- `dsh --dump-config --profile web` ends with:

  ```yaml
  # == dsh-codex-provider
  - id: llm-codex
    name: dsh-codex-provider
  ```

- `dsh web` booted to a printed URL with **no plugin-tree error** and stayed up.

The composed config proves the row was *composed*; it does not prove the plugin
*activated*. `test/verify-activation.mjs` covers that by composing the plugin the
way the loader does, against the real `LlmRuntime` and a real settings provider:

```
route           : codex="Codex (ChatGPT)"
configurable    : codex ns=llm-codex
settings ns     : llm-codex
[live catalog]  : gpt-6-astra, gpt-reserve, gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-5.6-terra,
                  gpt-5.6-luna, gpt-5.5, codex-auto-review
context         : 272000 | efforts: low/medium/high/xhigh/max/ultra
settings write  : refreshMinutes 9 accepted
```

An HTTP probe of the running harness was attempted and abandoned: the plugin is
host-side and contributes no client surface, so there is no route to query. The
check above is the honest substitute, and it is what would have caught a row that
composed but never activated.

## Origin failover, found by an outage during development

Mid-development, `chatgpt.com` began failing its TLS handshake:

```
GET /models -> TRANSPORT: TLS handshake with chatgpt.com:443 failed
               (Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established)
```

**It was not the plugin.** Established by isolating each layer:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `curl -x <proxy> https://github.com` | 200 |
| `curl https://www.google.com` (direct) | 200 |
| `curl -x <proxy> https://chatgpt.com` | exit 35 (schannel: failed to receive handshake) |
| `curl -x <proxy> https://chat.openai.com` | 308 |
| Bare Node CONNECT + TLS to chatgpt.com, **no plugin code** | same failure |
| Plugin transport to `chat.openai.com` | 308 — full CONNECT + TLS + HTTP/1.1 framing |

The tunnel established (`HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established`) and then the TLS
handshake died — identically in curl, in raw Node, and in the plugin. The route
to that one host was down. It recovered on its own minutes later and `/models`
returned 200 again.

The outage exposed a real robustness gap: the transport had a single hardcoded
origin. The Codex CLI treats two origins as interchangeable for this API —
readable from its own string table as `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`
**and** `https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/codex` — so one host being
unreachable need not take the route down.

`codexRequest` now retries against the alternate **only for transport-level
failures** (`TRANSPORT`, `TIMEOUT`). A provider status is never retried: a quota
answer is the endpoint's real reply, and repeating it per origin would spend
requests against an allowance that resets hours later.

**Failover applies only to the built-in origins.** A user who sets `baseURL` to
a self-hosted gateway or a compatibility proxy means exactly that host; silently
redirecting their traffic to OpenAI's endpoint would be both surprising and a
data leak. A custom origin fails on its own. Three tests pin this down,
including one that would have caught the leak.

## The one thing still unverified, and what was done about it

The streaming event vocabulary is the only part of the contract that could not
be confirmed against a successful live turn — the subscription was rate-limited
for the entire development window.

Three approaches were attempted:

1. **Wait for quota.** The backend reported a reset ~26 hours out
   (`resets_in_seconds` ≈ 91,000 throughout). The Codex CLI independently
   confirms the same wall, reporting *"try again at Sep 19th, 2026 6:19 PM"* —
   so this is the account's own accounting, not a plugin defect.

2. **Capture the wire directly.** `test/capture-sse.mjs` runs the plugin's own
   transport against the real endpoint and dumps every frame. While the account
   is limited the backend answers with a JSON error before any SSE frame, so
   nothing was captured. This script is the first thing to run once quota
   resets.

3. **Read the Codex CLI binary.** The client parses the same stream, so its
   string table should list the event names. This produced **contradictory
   readings across successive attempts** and was abandoned as unreliable:

   - A plain substring search reported `response.output_text.delta` absent.
   - Dumping the raw neighbourhood of `output_text` showed
     `...output_text.done...` and `...output_text.delta...` both present,
     because Rust packs literals with non-printable separators and glues
     adjacent literals together.
   - A separator-tolerant matcher then reported *every* name absent, because
     the gap between fragments exceeds any safe cap.
   - Reassembling by suffix produced yet another answer.

   The honest conclusion is that **binary archaeology cannot settle this**, and
   the earlier claim in this repository that the CLI "does not parse a
   text-delta event" was a false negative that has been removed. No code was
   changed on the strength of it.

**What was done instead**, since the uncertainty itself is the risk: the
translator no longer depends on exact event names. Exact names are still
handled precisely, and anything unrecognized is dispatched by **shape** — an
event carrying a string `delta` is classified by whether its name mentions
reasoning, arguments, or text; an event carrying a `response` object with a
terminal status ends the turn; an event carrying an `error` surfaces it; an
event carrying a full `item.message` yields its text.

That converts an unknown-vocabulary failure from *"the turn silently comes back
empty"* into *"the turn works, possibly with slightly worse attribution."*
Eight tests cover the fallback, including that a genuinely inert unknown event
is still ignored and that an exact-matched event is not double-counted.

A real bug surfaced while writing those tests: a tool call assembled purely from
deltas did not set the "saw a tool call" flag, so such a turn was reported as
`EMPTY_RESPONSE`. This is the same defect class as item 1 in the bug table
below, in a different code path, and it is now fixed and covered.

## Header and version probing

Reasoning about the wire contract from documentation was not good enough, so
each assumption was tested against the live endpoint. `/models` does not consume
quota, which makes it usable as a probe target while the account is rate-limited.

**Which headers are load-bearing.** Each was removed in turn:

```
/models with each header removed in turn:

all headers (baseline)                         OK
- chatgpt-account-id                           OK
- originator                                   OK
- version                                      OK
- OpenAI-Beta                                  OK
- user-agent                                   OK
- all optional headers                         OK

Is client_version load-bearing on /models?
no client_version query                        400 — missing query client_version

Is the Authorization header load-bearing?
no bearer token                                401 — missing_end_user_auth
```

Conclusions, all of which corrected an earlier assumption:

- **Only `Authorization` gates the request.** The remaining headers are
  advisory on this route.
- **`client_version` is a required query parameter**, not optional — omitting
  it is a hard 400.
- **`OpenAI-Beta` is not validated.** Any value is accepted, including none.
  The plugin sends `responses_websockets=2026-02-06` because that is what the
  installed Codex CLI binary actually sends, so the request is
  indistinguishable from a first-party client — not because the backend
  requires that specific string. (An earlier revision sent
  `responses=experimental`, the value the public Responses API documents; that
  works too, but it is not what this backend's own client sends.)

**Client version discovery.** Because `client_version` is validated, a
hardcoded literal ages out silently across Codex upgrades. The plugin now reads
the version from the local installation — `models_cache.json` first, then the
installed `@openai/codex` manifest — and reports that:

```
codex home     : C:\Users\Administrator\.codex
plugin default : 0.155.0
discovered     : 0.155.0
```

Configuration (`llm-codex.clientVersion`) overrides discovery when set.
Discovery is a filesystem read and happens once per catalog instance, not once
per refresh; a test asserts that.

## Live backend checks

`node test/live-transport.mjs`

```
auth   : resolved (account <redacted>)
proxy  : {"host":"127.0.0.1","port":7897}
/models status: 200
models: gpt-6-astra, gpt-reserve, gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-5.6-terra,
        gpt-5.6-luna, gpt-5.5, codex-auto-review
sample: {"slug":"gpt-6-astra","context_window":272000,
         "max_context_window":872000,
         "efforts":["low","medium","high","xhigh","max","ultra"],
         "modalities":["text","image"],"display":"GPT-6-Astra"}
```

This proves credential resolution, the CONNECT tunnel, TLS, the required
headers, and response framing against the real endpoint.

`/responses` returned **HTTP 429 `usage_limit_reached`** throughout
development — the subscription allowance was exhausted by prior use, with the
backend reporting a reset about 26 hours out. That is the backend's own
accounting, not a defect: the plugin classifies it as `QUOTA` with a reset hint
rather than treating it as a retryable rate limit.

## Harness integration

`node test/integration.mjs` — the plugin mounted in a real Cordis context with
the real `LlmRuntime`:

```
registry providers before: []
registry providers after : [ 'codex' ]
codex route registered   : true Codex (ChatGPT)
listModels               : gpt-6-astra, gpt-reserve, gpt-5.6-sol,
                           gpt-5.6-terra, gpt-5.6-luna, gpt-5.5,
                           codex-auto-review
inputModalities          : ["text","image"]
contextWindow            : 272000
reasoning efforts        : low, medium, high, xhigh, max, ultra
systemPromptUpdate       : in-history
configurable providers   : codex(llm-codex)
stream chunk types       : block-start,text-delta,block-end,usage,finish
stream text              : "integration ok"
stream finish            : {"type":"finish","reason":{"kind":"stop"}}
```

A full turn through the harness's own streaming API, from message in to finish
chunk out.

## Isolated harness boot

```sh
DSH_HOME=<scratch> dsh plugin --profile web add <package>
DSH_HOME=<scratch> dsh web --port 3099 --no-open
```

- The profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` gained `dsh-codex-provider`.
- `dsh --dump-config --profile web` ended with:

  ```yaml
  # == dsh-codex-provider
  - id: llm-codex
    name: dsh-codex-provider
  ```

- `dsh web` booted to a URL with **no error** — the plugin tree loaded, which
  is the failure mode a broken provider plugin usually produces.

The production harness on its own `DSH_HOME` was never written to.

## Bugs found and fixed during development

Recorded because each was caught by a test rather than by inspection:

| # | Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tool-call turn reported as an empty response | `#sawToolCall` only set on `output_item.added` | Also set it on `output_item.done` |
| 2 | Content silently dropped when a stream ended early | A block opened but never closed by `output_item.done` was never emitted | Accumulate deltas and close dangling blocks in `end()` |
| 3 | `prettifyModelName` produced `Gpt-5.6-Luna` | Naive capitalisation | Preserve known initialisms |
| 4 | Every local test hit a TLS handshake error | Transport always wrapped in TLS | Apply TLS only for `https:` |
| 5 | `adapter.prepareCall is not a function` | Adapter was a plain class, not an `LlmAdapter` subclass | Extend `LlmAdapter` |
| 6 | Settings namespace never registered | Guessed `settings.install()`; the real API is `installSection(owner, ns, schema, entry, {setSource, onChange})` | Use the real signature and read through the `setSource` thunk |
| 7 | Stub backend unreachable, `HTTP 0` | `HTTPS_PROXY` routed loopback through Clash | Never proxy loopback/private hosts |
| 8 | Response status stayed `0` against a local peer | Listeners attached *after* `socket.write`; a fast peer answered in the same tick | Attach listeners before writing |
| 9 | Raw `ECONNREFUSED` reached the harness untyped | Socket errors not wrapped | Wrap connect and TLS failures in typed `LlmError`s |
| 10 | `client_version` hardcoded to a stale literal | Assumed optional; probing showed a 400 when absent | Discover the version from the local Codex install, overridable by config |
| 11 | Cancelling a stream hung for the full 120s idle timeout | The abort listener was detached once the socket connected, so an abort arriving mid-stream never reached it | Keep the listener for the whole request; detach only when the exchange finishes |
| 12 | A tool call assembled purely from deltas was reported as `EMPTY_RESPONSE` | The shape-based fallback did not set `#sawToolCall` | Set it when a tool-call delta is opened |
| 13 | A transient `chatgpt.com` outage took the whole route down | The transport had a single hardcoded origin | Fail over between the two built-in origins, transport failures only |
| 14 | Failover redirected a user's **custom** `baseURL` to OpenAI's endpoint | Failover was applied to every origin | Restrict it to the built-in origin set, so a self-hosted gateway is never bypassed |
| 15 | A throwing attachment service failed the whole turn | `projectImages` awaited the resolver without a guard | Degrade that one image to a placeholder instead of losing the turn |

Items 10 and 11 were found by probing and by a test that started failing for the
right reason — not by inspection. Item 12 came out of writing tests for the
fallback, which is the point of writing them.
